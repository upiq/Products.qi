  - remove ZCML include of removed package

  - removed footer viewlet and a registration in ZCML for an unused

    team_containing mfunctions from Products.qi.util.utils instead.  Remove
    unused qi.sqladmin import.

  - removed user list and user tracker views, we are not using these

  - users: remove currentusers view

  - removed measures sub-package and some unrelated old plone3-specific
    modules and setup handlers.

  - removed ununsed stylesheet

  - remove extranet pages sub-package

(uses navigation root); error page unneeded.

  - more cruft removal: report/chart package, extranet.foldermanagement
    package.

  - branding for mail from properties in Products.qi, these should be
    done in policy product, and are done in uu.qisite, but I wanted to
    change the defaults.

  - removed ref to deleted dirview from skins.xml

  - removed more mailing list cruft: CSS styles, this time.

  - removed pyExcelerator cruft (unused, and this is third-party
    anyway).

    layer/dirview, and removal of calendar portlet.

  - replace teamspace logo with UPIQ logo.

  - remove old plone 3 skin overrides cruft from Products.qi

  - remove custom skins cruft from profile

  - remove commented-out subscribers: noisy

* 2011-10-03  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - remove Products.qi setup import-step and handler for imap
    configuration -- this is the job of a site-policy product.


Pre-2.0 changes (UPIQ)
----------------------

*Many parts of Products.qi were removed or pared-down to essential
groupware/workspace (project and team) components.  Below are changes
that took place prior to this overhaul.*


* 2011-09-08  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Removed incorrect UID method on team, and commented-out UID method
    on project; these cause problems with plone.app.upgrade from 4.0 to
    4.1 -- or at least they act as gasoline to make this bug worse:
    http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12185

* 2011-08-22  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - adjusted copyright description in register.py since some code is
    from upstream

* 2011-08-19  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - cruft removal: remove unused zcml and handler for team add/modify

  - remove spurious event handler for project modification event that
    tried to add managers and faculty from unused object attributes

  - removed old commented out subscribers from users.zcml in
    Products.qi.extranet.types.handlers

  - cruft removal: Products.qi.extranet.types.browser.project -- remove
    ununsed imports and commented-out code

  - default theme on class variable for Project matches form default in
    IQIProject ("Sunburst Theme") appropriate to Plone 4.

  - removed unused imports and commented-out menu items from
    Products.qi.extranet.types.team

  - Products.qi.extranet.types.project: remove unused imports, remove
    unused getTeams() method; fix-up whitespace

  - more purge of PLONE_VERSION==3 compatibility shims, we don't need
    plone3 compatibility

  - remove plone3 compatibilty shims, we won't use them -- they are
    cruft at this point

* 2011-08-02  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - include plone.browserlayer in Products.qi zcml; this was omitted
    accidentally before, but was not strictly necessary in integration with
    other packages using it, but it is a good practice.

* 2011-07-15  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - removed reference to previously included overrides file for portlets
    from main overrides.zcml

* 2011-07-14  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - qi_content_workflow: more reasonable role mappings for private state
    permissions: allows use of the sharing tab; refs #231.

* 2011-07-12  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Products.qi portlet purge: removed all portlets except Calendar --
    especially and including overrides of stock Plone portlets.  The primary
    reason for this is that Plone 4 ships with portlets for news, events,
    recent items bound to navigation root (project), so the ad-hoc (and slow
    getObject()) filtering in the qi portlets is a bad idea versus the stock
    portlets which use path indexes and nav root.

  - Removed old Plone3 setup profiles for Products.qi; we're not going
    to ever use or need them as we are solidly depending on Plone 4 for a
    long while now!

* 2011-07-11  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - database port environment variable QI_SQLADMIN_DBPORT wasn't being
    set early enough in application startup by Products.qi, leading to
    qi.sqladmin and Django to have incorrect database settings.  Now, we
    call Products.qi.zope2.initialize(None) to set the environment variable
    on first import of Products.qi (from zope.conf product-config section,
    usualy via buildout config) instead of waiting for Zope2 to call
    initialize (it seems to defer until the entire ZCML is processed for the
    package, which becomes a problem).  The framework says: "don't call us,
    we'll call you."  I say, "I'll call you anyway, thanks."

* 2011-07-10  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - replace tabs with spaces in python source for a handful of
    Products.qi modules using vim %retab

  - Products.qi uses plone.browserlayer layer: marker interface and GS
    profile setup xml added; all viewlets and all views bound to any
    interface are specifically bound to the product marker interface, and
    the request will be modified only to provide that marker in sites where
    the GS profile is installed.

* 2011-06-27  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Added to zope2.initialize the ability to get product-config
    sqladmin.port value as host:port for postgresql database connection.

* 2011-06-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - #211: replace deprecated transaction.commit() calls with
    transaction.get().commit() and in some circumstances (in the XML export)
    with transaction notes on the context for the undo log.

  - #95: Products.qi now uses app config to get connection rather than
    hardcoding a ZEO connection for spawned worker threads for mailing list
    thread and XML export threads.  New module to get connection and
    application root in Products.qi.util.zodbconn.

* 2011-06-26  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - merged Products.qi modifications from export of partial history from
    uudev4 branch.  This includes moving to use hard-coded queries in Python
    for SQL, and using ZODB connections via zconfg avoiding hardcoded ZEO.

* 2011-06-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - removed use of parameterized SQL fixtures from text files, moved
    queries into source code and changed method name for running the queries
    to more accurately reflect what is going on.  The only place that uses
    raw SQL in Products.qi appears to be the datacapture sub-package for
    querying form status.

* 2011-06-03  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - #175 - methods to use a hybrid of catalog queries and ancestral path
    walk to find containing projects and teams.  This should be considered a
    more explicit alternative to using the Project.getProject() and
    Team.getTeam() via acquisition (not using acquisition increases clarity
    of what is happening in callers).  Note: this does not yet deprecate any
    existing use of the acquired methods on the types, but eventually doing
    so would remove some complexity from the types themselves and ambiguity
    from future code needing to resolve a containing project or team.

* 2011-06-02  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - missing zope2.py in package commit from changeset:uudev4,75

  - Removed RPC Auth plugin for repoze.who integration: not in use.

  - Replace deprecated imports from Globals from old Zope2 version
    assumptions.

* 2011-05-23  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - filter calendar search links from project calendar portlet to filter
    results to only Event type, excluding other types possibly defined with
    a start, end date attributes.

  - catalog-based getProjectsInContext and getTeamsInContext had
    variable name typo

  - more attempts to fix chart view use of non-existent data structures
    on context, use list() to cast set rather than attempt to find an
    attribute '_data' (in _data.keys(), which does not appear to work).

  - measure ids in view were not correctly working; attempts to iterate
    over measure ids in view.

  - Removed bogus claim that chart type implements IReferenceable.

* 2011-05-18  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - CMF description accessor deals with None Description values on
    Teams.

  - stop using globals shared across classes for form field definition,
    re trac ticket #161.

  - remove unused function from Products.qi.util.utils

  - use zope.app.component.hooks.setSite() in mailing list thread;
    setSite to portal on begin(), then setSite to None on end.  This may be
    necessity after moving to using zope.app.component.hooks.getSite() in
    Products.qi.util.utils functions.

* 2011-05-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - remove Products.qi.util.utils.default_addable_types; not used in
    meaningful substance; removed imports and calls in all callers, as this
    was not adding functional value to the code.

  - remove get_factory_permission() (now unused) from
    Products.qi.util.utils

  - remove unused imports in mail handler modules

  - minor Products.qi.util.utils refactoring: getSite() removed,
    replaced with use of zope.app.component.hooks.getSite(), calls adjusted
    for argument-less signature; use path-index in catalog instead of ZDOM
    traversal for getProjectsInContext() and getTeamsInContext() -- these
    are more sensible than recursive walking of the object graph.  Removed
    an unused function getListsForUser2, which appears to be a renamed
    function not used now and never previously removed.

  - Removed old, unused view classes for managing members in project,
    team; it appears this has long-since moved to
    extranet/users/browser/managemembers.py, so the old classes are unused
    in Products.qi: be gone!

  - remove more unused imports

  - remove unused imports

  - The only content event handler left (enable_addable_types) was
    simply enabling add-permissions for a role that is not used.  Seems
    suitable for removal (of cruft, risk).

  - remove unused or no-op content event handlers.

* 2011-04-19  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - #135 - teams can add (normal Plone) folders to team and subteam
    folders; changed allowed types in FTI.

* 2011-04-18  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - disabled QI Teamspace specific RSS portlet, unnecessary in Plone 4.

* 2011-03-28  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Removed claim on Project class that it implements IReferenceable; it
    does not.  Fixes #127.

* 2011-02-23  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Move away from using overrides for QI Teamspace colophon and footer
    viewlets, and register viewlets under product-specific names, add to
    profile.  This is an interim workaround to having an isolated layer for
    all viewlets that keeps viewlets from overriding from QI Teamspace sites
    to other Plone sites in the same zope instance.  Fixes #107.

  - Removed searchbox viewlet override from uudev4 Products.qi, not
    needed for Plone 4, which searches site-wide using navigation root
    (project); we should allow for the checkbox in the default Plone 4
    searchSection to allow searching only a specific folder.

  - Fix #66: Folder inside projects should not allow adding a project;
    this codes such behavior into the FTIs for project and plone site within
    the Products.qi default_plone4 profile.

  - Made Sunburst Theme default for projects in uudev4 branch (assumes
    Plone 4).

* 2011-02-03  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - member management view: adding users now generates random password
    and emails user using registeredNotify(), from which the new user can
    select their own password.  Help text explaining this is added to the
    member management form, and the password inputs have been removed.  The
    notify checkbox has been removed (since notification is always assumed,
    and it was never hooked up in the first place).

* 2011-02-02  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Site root menu item in "Shared Resources" menu, leaves site admins
    with Manager role ability to click out of a project into the root of the
    site, but does not allow others; needed to make absolute URL link
    targets possible for QI menu for this to work.  Fixes trac ticket #47.

* 2011-01-05  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - removed search, search form skins overrides from
    qi_plone4_overrides, these were not necessary for Plone 4 (since similar
    context-specific search is default) and because they caused errors in
    Plone 4.

* 2011-01-04  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Products.qi fixes for compatibility with automated integration test
    runner and PloneTestCase.  Logger now falls-back to stderr when log file
    using product-config cannot be opened.  Path bar viewlet no longer
    attempts to acquire another view in template, which is brittle, instead,
    code needed is proxied from viewlet class itself, readapting the context
(workable hack, reasonable for now).

* 2010-12-28  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - portlet title CSS: fix inconsistencies in typography.

* 2010-12-28  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Additional CSS styles for portlets and globalnav, customizing Plone
4 sunburst defaults to better match other customizations made.   Also
    removed IEFixes CSS overrides, as these are likely out-of-date.

* 2010-12-20  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - default_plone4 profile: allow self-registration in rolemap.xml

* 2010-12-20  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Add propertiestool.xml to default_plone4 profile, such that
    use_email_as_login is set to True, a sensible setting for all QI
    Teamspace sites.

* 2010-12-20  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Products.qi default_plone4 profile makes all types except project
    not implicitly addable, setting global_allow to False for most types.

* 2010-12-20  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - More modules cease using assumed relatative path to execution CWD,
    and now use Products.qi.util.config.PathConfig to get paths from
    zope.conf product configuration section instead: best-practice should be
    to populate all paths used by source in zope.conf via buildout.cfg.

* 2010-12-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - mail/newListener.py: use portal property email_from_address for from
    addr on admin_messages, if available, otherwise use hardcoded default
(previous behavior).

* 2010-12-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - mail/newListener.py now uses Products.qi.util.config.ZEO_ADDRESS for
    connection, which uses either product-config value from zope.conf or a
    hardcoded default.

* 2010-12-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Added imaphost to default (plone3) and default_plone4 extension
    profiles, copied as-is from baseline, since it was missing.  Best
    practice should be to use a policy product to override these values.

* 2010-12-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Removed register.cpy* from qi_plone4_overrides, this functionality
    is implemented in a new view for Plone 4 (in previous commit).

* 2010-12-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - XML export thread now gets ZEO address from product-config in
    zope.conf (e.g. provided from buildout) section for Products.qi, instead
    of using hardcoded value; if config option is not provided in zope.conf,
    fallback is to previous hardcoded port number (trying to move
    site-specific config out of code, where possible).

* 2010-12-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - remove print statement accidentally commited last rev

* 2010-12-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Fix to datacapture/form/status/summary.py backported from Adrian's
    bugfix here: - -
    http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~qitdevs/qiteamspace/5.0/revision/17

* 2010-12-17  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Fix for Django model select_related() calls, were not compatible
    with recent Django versions [select_related(1) fails, where
    select_related(depth=1) succeeds, so use kwarg]; form entry view: Django
    DateField expects either datetime.date object or different date format
    than provided previously, so just use datetime.date
(today=datetime.now().date() == date.today()).

* 2010-12-15  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - QI Menu for Plone 4: new template and CSS to work well with Sunburst
    theme, however, two distinct menu viewlets are registered in ZCML now,
    one for Plone 3, one for Plone 4 -- relying on profiles to hide the
    other version's viewlet from the viewlet manager, which works since we
    have distinct GS extension profiles for different Plone versions.

* 2010-12-14  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Find/replace all instances of view.context.request or
    view/context/request in templates and macros, replacing with
    view.request (appears necessary for Zope 2.12 compatibility in Plone 4,
    possibly acquisition related -- the context object does not get an
    attribute of request, which likely means it is not implicitly acquired,
    so using explicit binding of view.request is more sane).

* 2010-12-14  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Add last_activity to memberdata properties GS XML in default and
    default_plone4 profiles, and adjust code using last_activity to
    gracefully work when property is absent from member-data.

* 2010-12-14  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - New Project-specific registration form view for Products.qi on Plone
4, replaces, fills same need as the registration override in Plone 3
    skins (register.cpy): notify project managers of new registrations for a
    project.

* 2010-12-14  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - viewlet GS profile xml for Plone 4 (only): hide path_bar from
    portaltop manager, since that only makes sense for Plone 3; this is a
    more sensible approach to supporting multiple Plone versions than
    disabling ZCML registration to viewlet managers on a per-version basis.

* 2010-12-13  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Plone 4: Products.qi: mass search and replace all instances of
    self.context.request identifier in Browser Views with self.request
    instead, as self.context.request does not work in many cases.  All
    Browser Views multi-adapt both a context and a request, so self.request
    should always exist.

* 2010-12-13  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Fix for Plone 4: correctly configure skins layer qi_plone4_overrides

* 2010-12-13  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - merged into uudev4 import location fixes for Products.qi type
    importing AT IReferenceable

* 2010-12-13  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Replace import location for IReferenceable in content types (move
    away from deprecated module location in Products.Archetypes that will
    not work in Plone 4). Importing from AT interfaces package, instead of
    specific module should work in both Plone 3 and Plone 4 without using
    deprecated module location.

* 2010-12-13  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - remove import step putting ZPsycopgDA instance in the root of the
    Plone site, does not appear to be used by any code in Products.qi
    anyway; the only eggified Products.ZPsycopgDA package does not yet
    support the fact the icons for DAs were moved into Products.ZSQLMethods
    egg in Zope 2.12.9+.  There are several alternative solutions, the
    easiest of which (other than not using ZPsycopgDA) is to symlink the old
    Shared/DC/ZRDB folder into the Zope2 egg.  However, it was just easier
    to remove this from buildout and import steps.

* 2010-12-13  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - login_success.pt override for Plone 4 now based on Plone 4 template,
    with change made (use context/title instead of portal title for link) to
    effect same behavior as Plone3 version.

  - merges from uudev3 pull branch.

* 2010-12-10  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - First stab at a separate Plone 4 genericsetup extension profile
    separate from and not (yet) replacing the default (Plone 3) profile;
    added plone4 specific skins fsdirview, IAdding-based formlib add forms
    needed FTI tweak per:
    http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/version/upgrading-plone-3-x-to-4.0/updating-add-on-products-for-plone-4.0/add-views-for-content-types

* 2010-12-09  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Fix circular import problem I created earlier with PLONE_VERSION
    detection code; moved this from Products.qi.util.utils to
    Products.qi.util -- avoiding the issue

* 2010-12-10  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Explicit defines in templates for all identifiers relying on
    global_defines in Plone 3.  This should be compatible with both Plone 3
    and Plone 4, which removes the global defines necessitating this
    modification.  See:
    http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide/version/upgrading-plone-3-x-to-4.0/updating-add-on-products-for-plone-4.0/no-more-global-definitions-in-templates

* 2010-12-09  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - merges into uudev4 branch from uudev branch (all fixes designed to
    work in both Plone 3.3 and Plone 4), necessary, but not sufficient to
    get QI Teamspace working in Plone 4.

* 2010-12-08  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Fix XML well-formedness of all templates in Products.qi, such that
    all templates parse with z3c.pt (Chameleon) templates.  This does not
    guarantee XHTML validity, just that all templates are well-formed XML.
    WHY?  Plone 4 will optionally support use of Chameleon, which is much
    faster for templates, and later versions of Plone will eventually ship
    with Chameleon.  These templates were checked with
    z3c.pt.language.Parser().parse() and all now parse correctly.

* 2010-12-07  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Make Zope2 interface inheritance conditional on PLONE_VERSION, only
    use __implements__ declarations in Plone 3 (Zope 2.10), since Zope 2
    interfaces no longer exist in Plone 4 and Zope 2.12.

* 2010-12-06  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Appendum to last commmit: removing stray .metadata files in skins
(qi_plone_overrides) for removed override files.

* 2010-12-06  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Remove skin overrides for login_form.cpt and login_next.cpy; these
    overrides were previously necessary to support mutliple WSGI apps
    cross-linking to each other in a shared session, and keeping the
    "came_from" state value (for redirect on login) to allow for login page
    to redirect back to another application outside of Plone.  Without the
    Django admin app being part of QI Teamspace, this ceases to serve
    immediate, useful function, and is even less useful in a non-WSGI
    hosting stack for the application.  Thus, these two overrides are simply
    removed.

  - Conditional use of SecureMailHost dependent MailHost method call in
    contactinfo.py predicated on PLONE_VERSION==3. In Plone 4
    MailHost.send() is called using stock Zope 2.12 MailHost and
    zope.sendmail (which supports TLS out of the box).

  - Created 'default' exension profile and disabled 'baseline' base
    profile; the profiles appear to have parity with the base profile, and
    are much easier to manage (however, proper skin layer ordering depends
    upon a Plone 3.3.x buildout pinned to use Products.CMFCore==2.1.3, not
    the stock 2.1.2 -- this is to remedy
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope-cmf/+bug/161732 which was fixed in 2008,
    but not released until 9/2010; this might be the default package from
    some upcoming Plone 3.3.6).

  - Calendar tool fixes for compatibility with Plone 3.3 calendar
    portlets, and associated compatibly (method signature) change for QI
    Calendar portlet.

  - Added Products.qi.util.config.getcfg() function to make product
    config more reusable for future use, this allows any product
    configuration value in a <product-config qi> section to be obtained by
    any running code.

* 2010-11-16  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Plone 3.3 compatibility changes to portlet and jsregistry GS
    profile, plus addition of path configuration accessible from code that
    allows for common base paths (to var/, log/, src/sql, or whatever else)
    to be queried from code reading/writing files.  Modified testquery()
    function in Products.qi.util.utils to use new PathConfig lookup of base
    path (best practice is to spell out zope-conf-additional section with
    path configuration in buildout instance part).

* 2010-11-11  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Import feedparser normally, as it is not included in newer versions
    of plone.app.portlets, but distributed as is own egg on PyPI.  Falls
    back to importing from plone.app.portlets if ImportError (e.g. egg is
    not installed in older buildout).

* 2010-11-10  sean.upton@hsc.utah.edu

  - Minor setup.py modifications:

    + setup.py: change url to launchpad project URL
    + setup.py: should not need to import use_setuptools(), buildout should
      provide; remove this from setup.py and remove ez_setup.py from package
      directory.
    + setup.py: change license to GPL
    + setup.py: add these trove classifiers:
        "Framework:: Plone"
        "Framework :: Zope2"
        "License :: OSI Approved :: GNU General Public License (GPL)"
