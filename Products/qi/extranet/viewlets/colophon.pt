        Please keep the Plone Powered link (or the plone_powered.gif image) if you use
        Plone on your site. It's a nice token of gratitude, and we appreciate your
        help in promoting the Plone brand.

        Plone is powered by the combined forces of Zope and CMF, two absolutely
        great systems made by Zope Corporation (http://zope.com) and they in turn
        are based on the best programming language in the world - Python
        (http://www.python.org). We owe these guys a lot, thanks for making Plone
        possible!
